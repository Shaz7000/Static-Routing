# Static-Routing
Routers forward packets using either route information from route table entries that you manually configure or the route information that is calculated using dynamic routing algorithms.  Static routes define explicit paths between two routers, cannot be automatically updated; you must manually reconfigure static routes when network changes occur. Static routes use less bandwidth than dynamic routes. No CPU cycles are used to calculate and analyze routing updates.   Static routes have a default administrative distance of 1.You must specify only the output interface (the interface on which all packets are sent to the destination network) in a directly connected static route. The router assumes the destination is directly attached to the output interface and the packet destination is used as the next-hop address. The next hop can be an interface, only for point-to-point interfaces. For broadcast interfaces, the next hop must be an IPv4/IPv6 address.
